this assumes that reports will go in "$($env:USERPROFILE)\Documents\GitHub\$(
$param1.EscapedProject)\$($param1.Version)\Reports" but will return
the path in the $DatabaseDetails if you need it. Set it to whatever
you want in ..\DatabaseBuildAndMigrateTasks.ps1

You will also need to set SQLCMD to the correct value. This is set by a string
$SQLCmdAlias in ..\DatabaseBuildAndMigrateTasks.ps1

in order to execute tasks, you just load them up in the order you want. It is like loading a 
revolver.
